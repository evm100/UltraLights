We need to make a node creation tool that is compatible with our node registry system that facilitates creating the firmware for a new node and registering it. What it needs to do is help us build the firmware via the configuration of relevant sdkconfig values like choosing esp32/esp32c3/esp32s3,  enabling channels, choosing GPIO pins and setting optional override addresses. Implementing this new tool into our Server/ website would be ideal as a server-admin. This tool should also incorporate our updateAllNodes script as a function, as well as building new sdkconfigs on command from the node registry data with updateIndividualNode, which we will create and also firstTimeFlash, for flashing firmware to esp32 via the server's usb (idf.py build flash)
